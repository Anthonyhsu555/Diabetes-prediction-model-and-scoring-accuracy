# Diabetes-prediction-model-and-scoring-accuracy

Hi Everyone, 

In this file I will create a diabetes prediction model using logistic regression from sk-learn and include an accuracy scoring model. 

The dataset consists of the following factors on pregnancies,	glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin,	BMI,	diabetes pedigree function,	age, and outcome (1 if they have diabetes, and 0 if they don't have diabetes).

It also includes a chart showing the correlation of each factor and diabetes prevalence. Lastly, it includes a few graphs showing comparinig type 1 and type 2 errors as well as the f1 score.
